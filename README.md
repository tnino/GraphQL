Mongoose to GQL
Last week we introduced mongoDB and used mongoose to execute CRUD actions against a database. Now we have GraphQL which sits as a gateway for our database. Now see if you can build a GQL schema based off a mongoose model.
Instructions
Review the provided product model product.js - Mongoose Model.
Write a new product.gql file to match the mongoose model.
Create a Product type.
Account for any enum types.
Do you see any relationships to other models/types?
Next extend the Query and Mutation types to account for CRUD operations.
A Query for all products
A Query for a single product by ID
A Mutation to create a new product.
A Mutation to update a product by ID.
A Mutation to delete a product by ID.
Bonus Stretch Challenge
Create resolvers for each of the Query and Mutations.
Use mongoose methods to complete the CRUD operation.
Consider what to return to GQL.# GraphQL
